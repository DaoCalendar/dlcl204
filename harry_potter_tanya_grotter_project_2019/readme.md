# The Magical Word Vectors of Harry Potter and Tanya Grotter

This directory contains the materials that Quinn Dombrowski (the course instructor) put together for her final project for Stanford University's DLCL 204 course, "Digital Humanities Across Borders". The Jupyter notebook is heavily commented and could be used largely out-of-the-box for any other modern Russian text, and with some modifications (e.g. a different lemmatizer, or omiting lemmatization) for other languages.

The word2vec models can be loaded and analyzed/visualized with the Jupyter notebook.
