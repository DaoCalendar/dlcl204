    "# Analyzing Taiwanese rap lyrics: tone and \"flow\"\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook was developed for a student in [\"Digital Humanities Across Borders\" (DLCL 204, Stanford University, winter 2019](https://github.com/quinnanya/dlcl204) who was looking at how consecutive words that use the same tone contribute to the \"flow\" of the lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook takes lyrics saved in Unicode (UTF-8) encoded plain text files (one file per song), converts them to pinyin, then for each line, it counts the number of consecutive identical tones. It creates an output file for each song, and marks lines with 3 or more consecutive identical tones with an asterisk. At the moment, that's it! It'd be nice to also mark which tone is repeated, and how many times, but I haven't quite worked that out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required modules\n",
    "Before you can run this notebook successfully, you'll need to install a few modules. On a Mac, open the Terminal and run `pip install xpinyin` and `pip install regex`. If you get an error message about running _pip_, you can first run in Terminal `sudo easy_install pip`. Type the login password for your laptop when prompted (don't worry about nothing showing up when you type), and _pip_ should get installed, which will allow you to install the required modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File structure\n",
    "To work with this notebook, you should put all your lyrics in a single folder somewhere on your computer. You'll need to specify the location of that folder in the second code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If your computer is localized for Chinese (i.e. if the Mac system interface is in Chinese), when you look for the path (location) information for your folder, it will be displayed in Chinese. When you set the path in this notebook, it turns out that you need to use the default English names (e.g. use *Users* and *Documents* or *Downloads* in your path, even if those folders display with different names on your laptop.)"
