## Syllabus
Here's the first draft of the [online course syllabus](dlcl204syllabus.md) to lay out the broad outlines of the class. Specific readings for each week will be added based on the students' languages, backgrounds, and interests. Each student will have a 1:1 meeting with the instructor to come up with an individual plan for what tools and methods they'll be learning for their project. Examples include:

### Text acquisition

* Web scraping (using webscraper.io or Python)
* OCR (ABBYY FineReader, Google Drive)
* Transkribus

### Enrichment
* Named entity recognition (command-line Stanford NLP or Python-based packages)
* Part-of-speech tagging (command-line Stanford NLP or Python-based packages)
* Annotation (Recogito) + model training (e.g. for named-entity recognition)
* OpenRefine
* TEI markup

### Analysis/visualization
* Voyant
* AntConc
* Stylometry
* Topic modeling
* Text comparison algorithms + Tableau
* Network analysis (Palladio/Cytoscape)
* Mapping (Palladio/Tableau)
* XSLT
