# Digital Humanities Across Borders

_DLCL 204, CompLit 204A_

_Fall 2020_

_Asynchronous online_

Quinn Dombrowski (DLCL Academic Technology Specialist)

# Overview

English-language resources have dominated the discourse of digital humanities across the globe. This course takes a broader view, focusing on the methods, tools, and discourse of digital humanities as applied to textual materials in languages other than English. Students will develop practical skills in applying digital humanities research methodologies to texts in any language of their choosing. In addition, students will become familiar with major digital humanities scholarly organizations, movements, and debates that have their origins in different linguistic and cultural identities. No prior technical or digital humanities experience required, but students must have a reading knowledge of at least one non-English language (modern or historical).

# Credits / Grading

This course will be offered at Stanford for 3-5 credits, and for either a grade or credit/no credit. Students who wish to take it as part of the DH Minor must choose 5 credits (if taken as a core course) or 3 credits (if taken as an elective) and must take it for a letter grade.

The course will use contract grading, where students choose what grade they wish to receive, and write a contract (within defined parameters) at the beginning of the quarter that lays out the requirements for receiving that grade. Individual assignments will receive extensive feedback but will be graded as accepted / needs revisions. Students will have one week to revise assignments that need revisions to fulfill the terms of their contract. If a student is unable to fulfill the terms of their original contract, they will meet with the instructor and sign a new contract for a different grade.

# Assignments

This course will involve doing less reading than most courses in the humanities, and there will be neither papers nor exams. Instead, you&#39;ll get experience with reading and producing different kinds of scholarly production through 3-4 "major assignments" that will take the form of some alternative mode of scholarly production (e.g. conference proposals, posters, tutorials, blog posts, podcasts, videos, games).

In lieu of synchronous in-class discussion, there'll be weekly readings to comment on and discuss with your classmates using the Hypothes.is annotation tool (which may be available through Canvas, or may require a separate browser plug-in.) This syllabus will be updated with those readings after the course starts, as the selection of texts will be shaped by students' languages and interests. Occasionally, there'll be video lectures to watch, with opportunities to ask questions and discuss using the course message board. I'll also try to arrange and record an interview with someone doing DH work in each of the languages students are working with, and you'll have an opportunity to contribute questions to those interviews.

## Major assignments

Your path through this course will be shaped by the language and text you're working with, and your research questions / area of inquiry. Almost all text-based DH projects share the same broad trajectory:

* **Text acquisition**: Getting the text in a form that you can use for the subsequent steps. Can include scanning, OCR (turning pictures of text into editable text), handwritten text recognition, web scraping, etc.
* **Enrichment**: Doing something to your text to make it possible to do analysis / visualization. May include various forms of cleaning the data, annotating it (manually, or using algorithms to extract person and place names), adding metadata, etc.
* **Analysis/visualization**: Analyzing or visualizing the text in some way using the enrichment you've done. Includes things like topic modeling, text comparison, network analysis, mapping, etc.
* **Interpretation**: What sense can you actually make of the analysis, given what you know already about the subject matter? 

The course will be broken up into segments based on these different phases. Students will complete one major assignment for text acquisition, enrichment, and analysis/visualization (3 credits). 5-credit students will also complete a major assignment for interpretation. 

Major assignments can take many different formats, for instance:

* A set of texts that you've scanned and OCR'd, with a 1-page written reflection on the process (what worked well, what was challenging, what surprised you, etc.)
* A collaborative podcast with some of the other students working on the same language or tool, comparing your experiences working on a particular phase of the project
* A step-by-step tutorial for how to use one of the tools for your project, including details specific to your language
* A pair of conference proposals for your project, one for a conference in your discipline, and another for a DH conference
* A choose-your-own-adventure game/story that takes the reader through major decision points when working on a textual DH project in your language

I'll prepare some examples before the class starts, but other creative formats are also welcome! Check with me if you have any questions.

By default, each major assignment will be due after the corresponding phase of the class, to help you stay on track throughout the quarter. That said, the deadlines can be flexible if you need more time on one or more of the assignments; please let me know if you'd like an extension. All work should be turned in by November 30th at the latest, so I can get you feedback and you can do any revisions prior to the *absolutely final deadline* of December 4th (grades are due on the 8th).


# Weekly schedule

## Week 1 (September 21): Introductions
One of the challenges of teaching this course is that I don't know what languages people are interested in until they arrive. (If you're enrolling in the class, it helps if you email me in advance and let me know what language you'll be working with!) The first week will give us a chance to get to know one another, and I'll try to find some existing DH work that might resonate with your linguistic and topical interests. I'll also share a few different perspectives on what DH is, and what it looks like in practice to do DH work.

During week 1, I'll start holding 1:1 meetings with students to talk about what they're interested in working on this quarter.

This week's readings are an introduction to major themes you'll encounter in the communities that make up digital humanities:

* Lisa Spiro's "['This is Why We Fight: Defining the Values of Digital Humanities](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/9e014167-c688-43ab-8b12-0f6746095335)" (2012) looks to define shared values as a way to find common ground within the (still ongoing) debates about what DH is.
* The piece "[Donner à lire les humanités numériques francophones](https://journals.openedition.org/revuehn/508)" (2020) from the editorial board of *Humanités Numériques* (the journal of the Francophone DH association [Humanistica](http://www.humanisti.ca/)) talks about how the journal came to be, as part of the process of forming and defining the field of Francophone DH. If you don't comfortably read French, Google Translate works fine, but be sure to check back with the original particularly around terminology, which gets a little lost in the translation (e.g. in paragraph 5, '*"Digital Humanities" materialized in English-speaking countries - then everywhere else, sometimes with local names. The genesis of the journal is, in fact, deeply rooted in the European and French development of digital humanities.'* loses the fact that the first reference to "digital humanities" uses the English term, and the second uses the French term.)
* "[Digital Humanities: Is it Research or is it Service?](https://dhmuc.hypotheses.org/2834)" by Arnold Eckhart (2020) on the Digital Humanities München blog gets more concrete about what kinds of tasks go into doing DH, and reflects on the extent to which they should be considered "research" or "service". (Over the course of the quarter, you'll see other perspectives that challenge how meaningful or useful this dichotomy is, but it covers some common ways of talking and thinking about DH.)
* "[Leaving Humanist](https://linguacelta.com/blog/2020/08/Humanist.html)", a blog post by UK scholar Bethan Tovey-Walsh, is a piece for the present moment. This summer, a number of major DH organizations issued statements on Black Lives Matter, structural racism, and establishment violence. (We'll read these later in the quarter.) Shortly thereafter, Willard McCarty, who won an award for lifetime achievement in DH in 2013, approved a post referencing "anti-white racism" on [Humanist](https://dhhumanist.org/), the DH discussion mailing list he has curated since the late 1980's. His reluctance to approve responses to this post caused a backlash from many DH scholars, and the list ultimately went on hiatus. This piece serves as a the counterweight to Spiro's values of digital humanities: what happens when people understand those values differently, particuarly as they intersect with rapidly-evolving developments in some (but not all) national contexts?


## Week 2 (September 28): Pathfinding / Text acquisition
During week 2, I'll continue holding 1:1 meetings with students to plan out the quarter. As those plans take shape, I'll start organizing meet-ups with groups of students, based on shared languages and/or tools. These will take place throughout the quarter.

Students will start to work on the text acquisition phase of their project.

## Week 3 (October 5): Text acquisition
Students will continue to work on text acquisition during week 3, and will prepare their assignment for the text acquisition phase. I'll be available throughout the week for troubleshooting help and advice.

## Week 4 (October 12): Enrichment
Students will work on enriching the texts they acquired in the first phase, and will finish their text acquisition major assignment.

## October 16: Major assignment 1 due
The text acquisition major assignment is due, unless you've arranged for a different due date.

## Week 5 (October 19): Enrichment
Students will continue to work on enriching their texts and preparing their enrichment major assignment. 

## Week 6 (October 26): Analysis
Students will begin work on analyzing their enriched texts.

## October 30: Major assignment 2 due
The enrichment major assignment is due, unless you've arranged for a different due date.

## Week 7 (November 2): Analysis
Students will continue working on analyzing their enriched texts, and will begin work on their major assignment. Particularly in this phase, students might discover that the initial tool or method they were using may not be doing what they hoped, and may end up changing their approach. Reflecting on this change can be the basis for a major assignment.

## Week 8 (November 9): Interpretation
Students will work on making sense of the results of their analysis, in the broader context of the texts that they are studying. Students taking the course for 5 credits will begin work on a major assignment on this aspect of their project.

## Week 9 (November 16): Wrap-up 
As a class (collectively, and in language- and/or tool-specific sub-groups) we'll consider what we've learned through this class, and how we can apply it moving forward in different contexts (in other classes, as CV/resumé fodder, as a way to pursue questions that interest you). Depending on students' interest, I may organize an optional digital poster session / virtual exhibit for students' major assignments.

## November 20: Major assignment 3 due
The analysis major assignment is due, unless you've arranged for a different due date.

## November 30: All work due
November 30th is the deadline for turning in all work (including major assignment 4 for 5-credit students), with enough time for me to send you feedback and you to do revisions, if needed.


# Format and COVID-19
This course has been completely restructured into an online, asynchronous course in response to COVID-19, with all the potential associated challenges around time zones, connectivity, and combining education with increased care responsibilities. This format does have advantages: one of the biggest challenges for people working on non-English DH while based in the United States is that it can be challenging to build community locally, or even regionally. Running DLCL 204 asynchronously online makes it feasible for more people to participate, regardless of their location.

## Zoom
1:1 student meetings, open office hours, student meet-ups, and some troubleshooting sessions will take place via Zoom. Other than the 1:1 student meetings, participation in these meetings is encouraged but optional. Use of video on Zoom is not required, but particularly for troubleshooting and student meet-ups, you may find it helpful to share your screen.

## Slack
Everyone will be working on their projects at a different pace, at different times of day. To avoid the turnaround time of exchanging email every time you have a question, I'll set up a Slack channel for the class, or you can message me privately. Use of Slack is not required, but may make it faster to get the answers you're looking for -- from me, or your classmates.


# Accommodation

I want this class to be accessible to anyone who shows up with an interest in the topic. Everyone has a right to the full experience of the class — which is fundamentally about what role digital tools and methods might play in your education and/or research, and how you might choose to connect with and contribute to communities of "digital" scholarship. Grappling with your identity as a student and/or scholar can be difficult. If there's something in the syllabus or that we cover in class that freaks you out, please talk to me! If you're encountering a barrier, or expecting a possible barrier to your being able to successfully complete your contract, let's chat! It doesn't need to be academic — sleep-training kids, taking care of unwell family and friends, roommates who listen to Viking metal bands at full volume at all hours of the night, and anxiously binge-watching Netflix are real life. Mental illness flare-ups can impact what you can get done — I know, I had a bipolar II diagnosis for all of grad school. Whether or not you've got paperwork through the Office of Accessible Education (<https://oae.stanford.edu/>), please come talk to me anytime if something is getting in the way of your learning or completing the contract you created.

The pandemic and all ongoing uncertainty around it are complicating life for everyone, in different ways. Regardless of your situation, I want this class to be an enriching, thought-provoking experience for you. Please get in touch (using any contact methods listed on Canvas that's comfortable for you) if anything comes up that you think might pose a challenge for you to successfully complete the class, and together we can figure out a way to work things out.

# Fundamental standard & honor code

Beyond the bare minimums laid out by the Stanford Fundamental Standard (<https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/fundamental-standard>), I expect you to treat one another in this class not only with respect, but with generosity. If you find a resource or an approach that has helped you, share it so others can benefit -- and listen when others share.

The honor code (<https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-and-guidance/honor-code>) lays out guidelines for the university's policy on academic integrity. Collaboration -- with your classmates and others -- is very much welcome in this course, but be sure to acknowledge your collaborators and the assistance they provided (e.g. including in your acknowledgements section a cousin who helped you interpret some of the statistics from your analysis.)
